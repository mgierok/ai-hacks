# Frontend Design

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

- Define the purpose: what problem does the interface solve and who uses it?
- Choose a tone: pick an extreme (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian).
- Identify constraints: framework, performance, accessibility, and other technical requirements.
- Decide the differentiator: the single detail people will remember.

Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Intentionality matters more than intensity.

## Implementation Goals

- Build production-grade, functional code.
- Make the UI visually striking and memorable.
- Keep the design cohesive with a clear aesthetic point of view.
- Refine details relentlessly: spacing, typography, hierarchy, and finishing touches.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- Typography: select beautiful, characterful fonts; avoid default stacks like Arial, Inter, Roboto, or system fonts. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- Color and theme: commit to a cohesive palette. Use CSS variables for consistency. Favor dominant colors with sharp accents over timid, evenly distributed palettes.
- Motion: use animations for high-impact moments and micro-interactions. Prefer CSS-only solutions for HTML, and use a motion library for React when available. Lead with a strong page-load sequence and staggered reveals.
- Spatial composition: break the grid, embrace asymmetry, overlap elements, and use diagonal flow when it supports the concept. Balance generous negative space with controlled density.
- Backgrounds and details: build atmosphere with gradient meshes, textures, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## Avoid Generic Aesthetics

Never use generic AI aesthetics like overused fonts, cliched color schemes (especially purple gradients on white), or cookie-cutter layouts. Make unexpected choices that feel designed for the specific context.

## Match Complexity to Vision

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalist concepts need elaborate code and effects; minimal concepts demand restraint, precision, and subtlety. Push for extraordinary creative work and do not hold back.
